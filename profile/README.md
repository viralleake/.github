The girls are now in the sophomore year at Essex College and all seems to be back to normal until four become three

Despite being the comedy with the most does-what-it-says-on-the-tin title possible, "The Sex Lives of College Girls" season 3 is still capable of providing surprises and there are plenty this time round including cosplay involving the school mascot in full outfit mode. But things are changing for the girls.

Here's how you can watch "The Sex Lives of College Girls" season 3 online around the world and from anywhere with a VPN.

How to watch 'The Sex Lives of College Girls' season 3 from anywhere with a VPN
If "The Sex Lives of College Girls" season 3 isn't airing where you're currently located, that doesn't mean you have to miss the show while you're away from home. With the right VPN (virtual private network), you can stream the show from wherever you are.

We've evaluated many options, and the best VPN you can get right now is NordVPN. It meets the VPN needs of the vast majority of users, offering outstanding compatibility with most devices and impressive connection speeds. You can try it risk-free for 30 days if you take advantage of NordVPN's no-quibble money-back guarantee.

If season 2 brought disastrous relationships, ex-boyfriend issues, bad hook-ups and all the rest of life at Essex, at least Kimberly, Leighton, Bela, and Whitney could be relied upon to deliver drama and great comedy every episode as Gen Z's indomitable female fab four.

Leighton is now out of there - although she will appear in a handful episodes in season 3 - and Kasey is in with her long-term boyfriend and irritating ways. How will the girls react? What happens now? Whatever it is, you know it's going to make you laugh and cry.
